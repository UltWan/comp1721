Weather Station Readme File

Notes: 

-This program is designed to sort through data from various weather stations.

-This program can be tested by running the "basictests" executable from the "test" folder found in "cwk1" and running the "WeatherInfo.java" file.

-Work is split between the "WeatherRecords.java", "WeatherStation.java" and "WeatherInfo.java", which can all be found in the "src" folder; they can be opened and viewed in any text editor.

-The other files that are needed to run the program are the files found in the folder "cwk1" and  will be automatically handled by the testing program as long as they are in the same folder.

Instructions:

-The tests are performed in the "test" folder of "cwk1" by navigating to said "test" folder and entering:
	./basictests in to the command line

-The "WeatherInfo.java" is run by entering:
	javac WeatherInfo.java
	java WeatherInfo (xxx being the file name, which should be a txt file)
